# Predicting Telecom Customer Churn
# Domain Background
Telecommunication businesses have seen the adverse effects of customer churn on company revenue.
With the challenging dynamics in the telecommunications industry, reducing churn in the customer
base should be among any telecommunication company’s top priorities.
Companies should not only spend their valuable time and resources probing for new customers, they
must keep their existing customers happy as it impacts their lifetime value and safeguards their
revenue.
According to various studies, acquiring a new customer is anywhere from 5 to 25 times more expensive
than retaining an existing one. Today’s telecommunication companies are doing everything they can to
retain their existing customers, but customer churn is still high.
# Solution
Though telecommunication companies have been putting in great efforts, they are still unable to
conquer the churn battle because they aren’t leveraging the bulk of data.
One of the reasons for this could be that most of the companies have been using traditional churn
prediction models that have been heavily dependent only on the data gathered from transaction
histories and demographics, but this method fails to integrate dynamic customer-generated input with
real customer needs, wants, and wishes.
So, having a churn prediction model that can leverage customer interactions and is built on the latest
technologies like machine learning and text analytics will help companies in analyzing the customer
interactions at scale to understand customer behavior.
# About the Data set
The data set includes information about:
1. Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
2. Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security,
online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
3. Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method,
paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
4. Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and
dependents
5. As well it consists of 7044 * 21 Cells of Info Ranging From Customer ID’s to their Churn State
6. Source: Telco Customer Churn programs from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
